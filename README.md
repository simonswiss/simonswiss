### Hi there 👋

My name is Simon, I am a Swiss front-end developer and wannabe designer living in Sydney, Australia.

I would take whatever you see in these public GitHub repos with a grain of salt.. They are mostly side projects and built with questionable practices and commit hygiene! 😅

[Hit me up on twitter](https://twitter.com/simonswiss) if you want to chat! ❤️
